# Alien-Invasion

This game "Alien Invasion" is fully made with Pygame.

In Alien Invasion, the player controls a rocket ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship right and left nad shoot bullets using spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and move across and down the screen. The player can shoots and destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits the player's ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.

I made this game with the help of a book named *"Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes* and I made some changes or add some feautures like bullet shot sound,background image etc...
